## Notes
- This is a collection of my notes for all sorts of things
#### File Structure
- The most interesting folder for you will likely be TUM
- Inside it, you will find folders organized into semesters and courses
- Inside each course folder there is a file with the same name
- This file functions as a directory for the course with links to relevant pages
#### Tools
- While GitHub offers markdown support and pages can thus be viewed directly in the browser, the use of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) is highly recommended
- Inside Obsidian, helpful images are displayed and links behave like intended
