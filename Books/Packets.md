- In order to prevent larger messages from blocking the entire networks, a message would be split into equally sized packets
- Those packets could then be sent across the network seperately and more quickly
- In order to receive the packets at the correct destination, in the correct order, each packets has to contain information about its source and destination adress, as well as its offset
- Routers were developed, which are computers, specialized in sending packets along their shortest route
- Now, computers which were part of a Local-Area-Network, could send data across the Wide-Area-Network by connecting to a router
