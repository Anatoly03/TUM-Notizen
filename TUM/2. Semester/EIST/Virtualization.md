## General
- Virtualization is a method to virtually emulate physical machines
- Through virtualization a single machine can be used to provide hosting for multiple clients
#### Compute Virtualization
- A single physical server is partitioned into multiple virtual servers
- This can be realized using virtual machines or containers

#### Network Virtualization
- Hardware resources are combined to form a virtual private cloud
- This way, multiple isolated subnets can be managed

#### Storage Virtualization
- Multiple physical storage devices are abstracted as a single large unit of virtual storage
- This virtual storage can then be devided among multiple clients
