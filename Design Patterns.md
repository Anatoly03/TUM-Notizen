## Adapter Pattern
- An existing component offers the necessary functionality, however it's interface is incompatible with a new system
- An Adapter needs to be created, which maps the functionality of the component to the interface desired by the new system

## Observer Pattern
- An object might change its state often and have multiple views
- This object is modelled as a publisher, which can modify its state and add new observers
- The views are modelled as observers, which are notified if the publisher changes and can update accordingly

- Different algorithms are better suited for different situations, and a different one needs to be chosen based on the circumstances
